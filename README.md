## Overview

A website where users can connect with each other through meetups at trails inside our wonderful national parks! 

We created this web site to turn our love of national parks into a useful meeting place online. Turn those "cyber" hikes into "sight-bird" hikes!

## Description

[ParkPals](http://3.13.216.67:8080/ParkPals) allows registered users to create, join, unattend, or delete meetups with other users. Meetups allow users to display start and end times, descriptions, and a photo of the meetup. Users can also leave comments on meetups! 

See a user who isn't your friend? Add them to your friends list!

Rest assured that when you delete a meetup, your data is safely deleted.<sup>*</sup>

## Lessons Learned

This project really 

On the frontend, we all learned much more about designing a web page's layout and functionality. The size and placement of text really makes a difference not when just trying to view data, but to make it visually appealing.

Most importantly, the project taught us how to work as a team through the entire process: design to final presentation.
