## Overview

A website where users can connect with each other through meetups at trails inside our wonderful national parks! 

We created this web site to turn our love of national parks into a useful meeting place online. Turn those "cyber" hikes into "sight-bird" hikes!

## Description

## Lessons Learned

Working on this project taught us how to apply technologies we've learned up until now into a real working application. It wasn't until we stumbled and hit a brick wall several times with several things that things started to make sense.

* Building a database from scratch and then using the Data Access Object design pattern to build methods to read and alter the database.

* Carrying data across different web pages with <code>HttpSession</code>, using the <code>Java String Tag Library</code> to display that data.

* Using <code>git</code> to manage our codebase and allow team members to quickly update changes to everyone's local repository.

On the frontend, we all learned much more about designing a web page's layout and functionality. The size and placement of text really makes a difference not when just trying to view data, but to make it visually appealing.

Most importantly, the project taught us how to work as a team through the entire process: design to final presentation.
